This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Set up to use as a typescript project and styling and design system set up with styled-components and styled-system respectively.

## Getting Started

First, cd into the directory you wish to use or mkdir <projectName> and cd into that:

Then in the terminal run: npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/Davros2014/nextjs-typescript-boilerplate . --use-npm

@period after the Url indicates that you want the repo installing in the selected directory
@--use-npm - state explicitly unless you wish to use yarn
@--example or -e - use if you wish to use an existing repo as a base

Then run: npm run dev or npm next

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
